# About The Project 🦀

PincerOS is a bare-metal microkernel-based multi-core operating system written from the ground up in Rust targeting the Raspberry Pi 4b. The project aims to be a distributed, scalable, and secure operating system for general-purpose use. We aim to support a wide range of applications such as networked video games, distributed computing, and more.

## Targeted Features ✨

- Microkernel Architecture
- Multi-core Support
- Memory Management
- Process Scheduling
- File System with Journaling Support
- Inter-process Communication (IPC)
- Device Drivers
- Networking
- Security

## Architecture 📐
PincerOS follows a microkernel architecture with the following key components:

- Kernel Core: Handles basic system operations, syscalls, scheduling, and IPC
- Memory Management: Implements virtual memory and memory protection
- Device Drivers: Manages hardware interfaces
- Network Stack: Provides networking capabilities
- Security Module: Handles access control and system security

# Installation 📦
Currently, the project can be tested on QEMU version 9.0 or higher. If your package manager doesn't have it, you will have to build QEMU from source.

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- QEMU >= 9.0 (https://www.qemu.org/download/)

<!--
- llvm (https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html):
```brew install llvm``` or ```sudo apt-get install llvm```

**MacOS**
For a temporary fix on MacOS for issues related to llvm-objcopy:
```brew install binutils```
```sudo ln -s $(which gobjcopy) /usr/local/bin/llvm-objcopy```
-->

## Setup
1. Install Rust target:
```rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat```

2. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/pincerOS/kernel.git```

3. Build the kernel and run:
```cd crates/kernel```
```./scripts/build.sh``` to build and
```./scripts/run.sh``` to run.

We also provide scripts for debugging and running with ui:
`build-debug.sh`, `debug-ui.sh`, `run-rpi3b.sh`, `run-ui.sh`.
